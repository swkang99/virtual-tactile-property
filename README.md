# virtual-tactile-property

A computer vision project for predicting **roughness** from texture-related visual inputs.

## Input and Output

- **Texture image** -> Roughness
- **Texture PBR maps** -> Roughness

## Setup

### Python

A virtual environment satisfying `python>=3.9` is required.

### Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project was developed under the following environment:

- GPU: RTX 5080  
- torch: 2.8.0.dev20250415+cu128  
- torchvision: 0.22.0.dev20250416+cu128  


The `requirements.txt` file does not specify versions for `torch` and `torchvision`.  
Please install the appropriate versions based on your system configuration, referring to the environment above.

### Configuration

The configuration values required to reproduce the model are stored in `config.yaml`.

## Reproduction

The data can be downloaded from the supplementary materials of this study and should be placed in the data/original directory.

Run `demo.ipynb` to reproduce the reported results.
Execute all cells in order, or run the entire notebook at once.
